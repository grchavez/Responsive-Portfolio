	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<img src="images/gabe.png" class="profile-pic" alt="Mountain View" width="200" height="220">

	<p>My name is Gabriel Chavez, but you can call me Gabe.  I was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona and graduated from the University of Arizona with a bachelors of science in marketing.  After graduation, I started working for a digital marketing firm in the downtown area.  I learned a great deal about standard marketing practices, and I was also exposed to the thriving start-up and tech community.  It was there that I realized that I was more interested in the web development side of the firm rather than the marketing side.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle when I'm not working on development.  I workout at least four times a week, but I also love to eat so really I'm just balancing everything out.  I enjoy playing video games with my friends, both on PC and PS4.  My current favorite game is Divinity: Original Sin 2.</p>
